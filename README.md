Experimental and analytical study of a vibratory system with multiple degrees of freedom (GL) - using MATLAB

The following project aims to describe the experimental and analytical study of a vibratory system with multiple degrees of freedom (GL), proposed in the Vibration Control course during the mechanical engineering course at UFSC. The experiment was carried out in a system composed of a three-level structure, supporting an additional mass.
Based on the concepts addressed in the classroom, and through the dimensions and mechanical properties of the relevant components, a discrete system of three degrees of freedom was modeled, making it necessary to adopt some vitally important hypotheses, such as the behavior of the beams in relation to to its fixation.

Subsequently, these results were compared with those obtained through empirical data. Such an experiment took place so that while a given floor of the structure supported an additional mass, another was excited. Through proper instrumentation, the system's behavior was recorded.

Finally, a dynamic neutralizer was designed to attenuate one of the system's vibration modes.
